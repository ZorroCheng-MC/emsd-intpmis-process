# Introduction

The System Installation plan describes the procedure and schedule for deploying the application in the production environment, including 3 parts of the system:

- Database Server
- Backend Server
- Frontend and Web Portal Server

# Project Environment Description

## Network Diagram

Below is a logical network diagram in 1/F West Kowloon Government Office for production and UAT site.

[DIAGRAM HERE]

The network will be separated into three zones: DMZ, trusted zone, and storage network.

A two-tier firewall setup will be used to form the trusted zone and DMZ. Incoming network traffic to the system must go through the DMZ before entering the trusted zone.

To utilize hardware resources more effectively, servers listed in section [1.3.3], except the backup server, will be set up in the form of virtual machines (VM) and consolidated into DMZ VM host servers and trusted zone VM host servers for each physical site. Two VM host servers will be built in each zone for the purpose of high availability.

Similarly, storage needed by all servers will be consolidated and provided by SAN storage. A dedicated network will be set up and interconnected with the VM host servers. The backup server will also exist in this storage-dedicated network to carry out backup tasks of VM host servers in DMZ and trusted zone.

The diagram below illustrates the physical setup.
